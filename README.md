# 8803-project

To train neural network copy data into tmp folder and run 
`python ./model/preprocess.py`
then run 
`python ./model/biencoder`
or if you wish for a crossencoder
`python ./model/crossender`

## Data
if you wish for the data please contact us, datasets are quite substantial for github and therefore we have opted to not include them. You can, however download them yourself using the scripts in the ./data folder. You will need the youtube

## Dependencies
we have include a yml file for a conda envionrment that should contain all the necessary packages to train models.
